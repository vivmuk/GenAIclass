                    <p>As compute costs decline exponentially, we're witnessing the democratization of artificial intelligence. What once required million-dollar supercomputers can now be achieved with affordable hardware, making AI accessible to organizations of all sizes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Implications for Society</h3>
                    <p>The plummeting cost of compute is driving a paradigm shift in how AI integrates into every aspect of society. DeepSeek R1 proved frontier-level reasoning could be achieved for under $6M, while open-source models continue to close the gap with proprietary systems.</p>

                    <p>A specialized type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data, mimicking how the human brain processes information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Face recognition in smartphone cameras and social media that can identify individuals in photos with remarkable accuracy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="definition-card" data-category="technical">
                    <h4>Large Language Models (LLMs)</h4>
                    <p>Advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand, generate, and manipulate language. They work by predicting the most likely next word in a sequence, enabling them to write essays, answer questions, and more.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> ChatGPT and Claude that can answer questions, write essays, and engage in natural-sounding conversations.</p>

                <div class="definition-card" data-category="technical">
                    <h4>Rule-based Systems</h4>
                    <p>Early AI programs that use explicit "if-then" rules created by human experts to make decisions. Unlike learning systems, rule-based systems follow predetermined logic paths and cannot adapt to new situations without being reprogrammed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Spam filters that use predefined rules to determine whether an email is spam based on specific keywords or sender information.</p>

                <div class="definition-card" data-category="technical">
                    <h4>Generative AI</h4>
                    <p>AI systems that can create new content such as text, images, music, and videos that didn't exist before. Unlike traditional AI that classifies or predicts data, generative AI produces original outputs based on patterns learned from training data.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> DALL-E and Midjourney that create realistic images and artwork based on text descriptions provided by users.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="definition-card" data-category="technical">
                    <h4>Neural Networks</h4>
                    <p>Computing systems inspired by biological brain structures, consisting of interconnected nodes ("neurons") that process and transmit information. They excel at recognizing patterns and can learn to perform tasks by analyzing example data.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Google Translate uses neural networks to provide increasingly accurate translations between languages, capturing nuances and context.</p>

                    <h4>Agents</h4>
                    <p>AI systems that can operate autonomously to achieve specific goals on behalf of users. They can perceive their environment, make decisions based on that information, and execute tasks with minimal human intervention.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="definition-card" data-category="technical">
                    <h4>Agentic AI</h4>
                    <p>Advanced autonomous AI systems that can chain together multiple steps, interact with software or services, make decisions, and adapt their approach based on outcomes. Agentic AI can complete complex tasks much like a personal assistant.</p>

                    <p>Crafting precise, detailed prompts is key to getting high-quality outputs from generative AI. Learning to communicate effectively with AI systems is a skill that improves with practice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Training Process – Data & Algorithms</h3>
                    <p>AI models like those powering CoPilot are trained on vast datasets, including business content, to understand context, language, and domain-specific knowledge relevant to your work.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Output Generation – From Data to Content</h3>
                    <p>When you provide a prompt, the AI processes it through its neural network, drawing on patterns from its training to generate contextually relevant content that meets your needs.</p>

                    <h3>State-of-the-Art AI Systems</h3>
                    <p>The AI landscape evolves rapidly with new models released regularly. Each company's flagship model represents its latest research and capabilities in the field.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Open vs Closed Ecosystems</h3>
                    <p>While some companies prioritize tightly controlled access to their models (closed source), others make their models available to the public (open source), often with specific licensing terms.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Geographic Availability</h3>
                    <p>Access to advanced AI models varies significantly by region due to multiple factors:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="geographic-factors">
                        <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Companies must navigate complex regional regulations like the EU AI Act, GDPR in Europe, or data sovereignty laws in various countries. This often results in regional versions of models with different capabilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Market Strategy:</strong> Model providers typically roll out access gradually, starting with their primary markets (often US-based) before expanding globally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Requirements:</strong> Some regions may lack the technical infrastructure needed to support high-demand AI services, limiting effective deployment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Export Controls:</strong> National security concerns may restrict access to cutting-edge AI capabilities in certain regions due to dual-use technology controls.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Open source models provide a partial solution to these geographic limitations, as they can be deployed locally without API restrictions—though they often require significant technical expertise and computing resources.</p>

                    <h3>The Race for Human-Level Performance</h3>
                    <p>As AI models grow more sophisticated, researchers use standardized tests to measure their capabilities against human performance. The "Humanity's Last Exam" benchmark evaluates models on complex reasoning, knowledge application, and problem-solving.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accelerating Performance Gains</h3>
                    <p>The 2026 generation of models has shattered previous records. Claude Opus 4.6 leads on Humanity's Last Exam and Terminal-Bench 2.0, while Gemini 3.0 achieves real-time video comprehension at 60fps. Smaller, efficient models continue to outperform earlier large models.</p>

                    <h3>Implications for Society</h3>
                    <p>With frontier models now achieving agent-level autonomy and million-token contexts, 2026 marks the shift from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator. Multi-agent teams, mechanistic interpretability, and new AI regulations are reshaping industries.</p>
