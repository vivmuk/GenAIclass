## 1. How Nano Banana Pro “Thinks”

Nano Banana Pro isn’t just an “image model” – it’s a **visual reasoning system** built on multiple engines that work together:

- **Layout Engine** – Handles grids, columns, visual hierarchy (great for dashboards, infographics, UX flows).
- **Diagram Engine** – Turns logical structures into diagrams with nodes, connectors, and labels.
- **Typography Engine** – Renders sharp, readable text with headings, hierarchy, and formatting.
- **Data Visualization Engine** – Converts numbers into charts, KPIs, indicators, and dashboards.
- **Style Universe Engine** – Maintains consistent style, palette, linework, and lighting across a sequence.
- **Brand & Identity Engine** – Detects and applies logos, brand colors, and visual identity.
- **Representation Transformer Engine** – Switches surfaces (blueprint → infographic → storyboard) while keeping the same underlying content.

**Mental model:**  
Treat your prompt like a **design brief**, not a one-line request.

## 2. Core Prompting Principles (The “Big 4”)

Most of the power comes from four key ideas:

1. **Start with the Work Surface**  
   Define *what kind of canvas* you want:
   - “A 6-panel storyboard”
   - “A comparative infographic”
   - “A dashboard with KPIs and charts”
   - “An editorial page with title, abstract, three sections”
   - “A 3-panel comic page”

2. **Layout First, Style Second**  
   Before talking about “watercolor” or “photorealistic,” decide:
   - How many sections / panels / columns?
   - Where do titles, charts, text blocks go?
   - Left-to-right or top-to-bottom reading flow?
   - Example:
     - “Horizontal strip layout with three equal panels”
     - “2×2 grid with regular margins”
     - “Left-to-right diagram with separate swimlanes”

3. **List All Components Explicitly**  
   Lists “activate” the engines and keep structure stable:
   - “Components:
     - title block  
     - two bar charts  
     - one line chart  
     - legend  
     - short text summary  
     - icons for each metric”

4. **Add Clear Constraints**  
   Constraints reduce visual chaos and hallucinations:
   - “No overlapping labels”
   - “Uniform spacing between all nodes”
   - “Text must remain sharp at small sizes”
   - “Use consistent icon style”
   - “Preserve brand colors and logo proportions”
   - “Character design must remain identical across panels”

## 3. Classic Image Prompt Elements (Google Guide)

When prompting Nano Banana Pro, **always cover these basics**:

### 3.1 Vision Setup: Story, Subject, Style

- **Subject** – Who/what is in the image?
  - “A stoic robot barista with glowing blue optics”
  - “A fluffy calico cat wearing a tiny wizard hat”
- **Composition** – How is it framed?
  - “Extreme close-up,” “wide shot,” “low-angle portrait,” “over-the-shoulder shot”
- **Action** – What is happening?
  - “Brewing a cup of coffee,” “mid-stride running through a field”
- **Location** – Where is this?
  - “A futuristic café on Mars,” “a cluttered alchemist’s library”
- **Style** – Overall aesthetic:
  - “Photorealistic,” “3D animation,” “film noir,” “watercolor,” “1990s product photography”
- **Editing Instructions** (if you upload an image):
  - “Change the man’s tie to green”
  - “Remove the car in the background”

### 3.2 Refinement: Camera, Lighting, Format

- **Aspect ratio & format**
  - “A 9:16 vertical poster”
  - “A 16:9 cinematic wide shot”
- **Camera & depth of field**
  - “Low-angle shot with shallow depth of field (f/1.8)”
  - “Overhead shot showing the full table”
- **Lighting & grading**
  - “Golden hour backlighting with long shadows”
  - “Cinematic color grading with muted teal tones”
- **Text integration**
  - “Headline ‘URBAN EXPLORER’ in bold white sans-serif at the top”
- **Factual constraints (for diagrams, infographics, timelines)**
  - “Scientifically accurate cross-section diagram”
  - “Ensure historical accuracy for the Victorian era”
- **Reference images**
  - “Use Image A for the character’s pose”
  - “Use Image B for the art style”
  - “Use Image C for the background environment”

## 4. Prompt Canvas – 8-Step Checklist

Use these 8 areas as a **pre-flight checklist** when writing prompts:

1. **Intent & Goal**  
   - What is this for? (e.g., pitch slide, learning diagram, comic page, storyboard, marketing asset)
   - What does “success” look like?

2. **Subject & Content**  
   - Who/what must appear?  
   - What’s the story or core message?

3. **Work Surface**  
   - Exactly what canvas type? (dashboard, infographic, storyboard, comic, blueprint, editorial page, etc.)

4. **Layout & Structure**  
   - Grids, columns, panel count, reading order, where each major block sits.

5. **Style & Aesthetics**  
   - Art style, era, palette, mood, level of realism, any visual references.

6. **Components & Details**  
   - Bullet-point everything that must be present (charts, icons, labels, callouts, characters, speech balloons, legends, etc.)

7. **Constraints**  
   - Rules about spacing, overlaps, consistency, text, brand colors, character identity, etc.

8. **Context / Source Material**  
   - Any text, data, copy, or story the image must reflect.  
   - Emotional tone or interpretation instructions.

You can literally walk through these eight in your head or in a small checklist before you paste the final prompt.

## 5. Reusable Prompt Template

Use this as a **standard Nano Banana Pro template** and fill in the brackets.

```text
[PROMPT START]
**WORK SURFACE:** [e.g., “Create a 3-panel comic page” / “Design a KPI dashboard”]

**LAYOUT:** [Describe structure and flow: panels/sections, grid, reading direction, where titles/charts/text go]

**COMPONENTS:**
• [Component 1]
• [Component 2]
• [Component 3]
• [Etc.]

**STYLE:** [Art style, palette, era, realism level, visual references, mood]

**CONSTRAINTS:**
• [Spacing rules, no-overlap rules]
• [Text legibility requirements]
• [Brand/identity constraints]
• [Character consistency, etc.]

**SOURCE MATERIAL:** [Any story text, data, bullets, copy, or requirements that must be represented]

**INTERPRETATION:** [How the model should treat ambiguity: what to emphasize, the emotional tone, what to prioritize]
[PROMPT END]
